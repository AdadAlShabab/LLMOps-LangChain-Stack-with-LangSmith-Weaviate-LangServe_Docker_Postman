# LLMOps-LangChain-Stack-with-LangSmith-Weaviate-LangServe_Docker_Postman

A production-grade LLM application with **LangChain**, **LangServe**, **Weaviate**, **LangSmith**, **Docker**, and **Postman** for seamless AI operations, observability, Debugging and API access.

---

## 📌 Features

✅ LangChain-powered LLM pipeline  
✅ LangSmith for tracing & observability  
✅ Weaviate vector database for semantic search  
✅ LangServe (FastAPI) for REST API interface  
✅ Dockerized for local or cloud deployment  
✅ Postman collection for API testing

## Use Cases This Project Supports
This project provides a strong base that can support or evolve into many real-world use cases. Here's a categorized breakdown:

 1. LLM API Gateway (What the project currently does)
Accepts input from external systems via a simple API (/invoke/my_chain)

Processes the input through a LangChain LLM chain

Returns the result (text, answer, response) via REST API

Logs the trace to LangSmith for observability

👉 Used for: Creating a secure, observable LLM inference microservice.

 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
By integrating Weaviate and feeding your documents (PDFs, web pages, support articles), you can:

Store document embeddings

Retrieve contextually relevant info using similarity search

Combine with LLM to answer user questions using your data

👉 Used for:

AI customer support agents

Internal knowledge bots

Semantic search engines

Contract/question answering tools

 3. Agent-based Workflows
By extending the chain logic:

Add tools like search, calculator, or Python execution

Add memory

Let the LLM call tools dynamically

👉 Used for:

Task automation

Chat agents with memory and tools

Autonomous agents (e.g., research assistant, SEO optimizer)

 4. Monitoring & Evaluation of LLMs
LangSmith tracks:

Inputs and outputs

Latency

Failures

LLM quality & accuracy (with test sets)

👉 Used for:

A/B testing prompts or chains

Evaluating LLM changes before deployment

Observability in regulated environments (e.g., finance, health)

 5. Secure LLM Backend for Frontend Apps
With the LangServe API:

Your frontend (React, Flutter, etc.) calls the API securely

Keeps API keys & LLM logic hidden from client

Allows scaling and deployment as a backend service

👉 Used for:

SaaS AI tools

Chatbots

Mobile AI apps
